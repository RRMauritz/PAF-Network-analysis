# PAF-Network-analysis
This repository contains implementations of mathematical models that can be used to numerically analyze degree distribution related properties of both the Preferential Attachment (PA) model as well as the Preferential Attachment with Fitness (PAF) model. For further reference, see the [project report](../FinalPaper.pdf).
