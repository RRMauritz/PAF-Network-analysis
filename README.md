# PAF-Network-analysis
This repository contains methods that can be used to numerically analyze degree distribution related properties of both the Preferential Attachment (PA) model as well as the Preferential Attachment with Fitness (PAF) model. These properties can be described by mathematical equations, as is done in [[1]](#1).
